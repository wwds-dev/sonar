"""Sports prop-bet analysis.

Ported from Sentinel's NFL agent, generalised so a second sport is a registry
entry rather than a rewrite. NFL is the only sport implemented today; the shape
below is what an NBA or soccer entry has to fill in.

The split matches the rest of SONAR: the arithmetic here is deterministic and
testable (odds conversion, implied probability, expected value, Kelly), and the
LLM is asked only for the narrative read on top of numbers it did not invent.
Nothing in this module places a bet — it evaluates one.

- You do not invent statistics. If a number you need is missing, say which one and reason without it.
- You do not express certainty you cannot support. "No edge" is a valid and common conclusion.
- Everything you produce is analysis for informational purposes, not betting advice.

Structure every response with exactly these headings:

PROP OVERVIEW
Subject, prop type and line, price, and the game context you were given.

OVER CASE
The factors supporting the over, drawn from the supplied data. Name the split or trend you are leaning on.

UNDER CASE
The factors supporting the under, and the scenarios in which the line holds.

EDGE ASSESSMENT
Lean: OVER, UNDER or NO EDGE.
Confidence: low, medium or high.
Estimated win probability as a percentage — this is the number the app converts into expected value, so give a single figure.

MISSING DATA
Anything you would want before treating this as actionable. Say "none" if the inputs were complete.
