"""The guard around AppKit's `clickCount` assertion.

macOS 27 made `-[NSEvent clickCount]` raise for events that have no click
count, and Qt's cocoa plugin asks for it whenever a menu begins tracking — so
opening the menu bar item's menu aborted the process. Two unrelated PySide6
apps here produced byte-identical stacks.

These run against the real Objective-C runtime, because a mock of AppKit would
be a mock of the thing being tested. They are skipped off macOS.

Ported from `lab_hub/tests/test_appkit_guard.py` along with the guard itself.
Both copies go when Qt ships a fixed cocoa plugin; until then keep them in step.

SONAR needs this more than most: closing the window hides it to the menu bar, so
that menu is the way back in, not a corner of the app.
