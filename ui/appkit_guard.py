"""A guard against an AppKit assertion that kills Qt apps on macOS 27.

## The crash

Open a menu bar item's menu and the app aborts:

    -[NSEvent clickCount]
    -[NSAssertionHandler handleFailureInMethod:...]
    objc_exception_throw  ->  std::__terminate  ->  abort

Qt's cocoa plugin observes `NSMenuDidBeginTrackingNotification` and reads
`clickCount` off the current event to tell a click from a click-and-hold. On
macOS 27 the current event at that moment is not always a mouse event, and
`clickCount` **raises** rather than returning zero for those. Nothing in the
notification-post path catches an Objective-C exception, so it unwinds through
C++ frames into `terminate()`.

It is not this app's bug. Two unrelated PySide6 apps here — Lab Hub and SONAR —
produced byte-identical stacks on the day the machine went to macOS 27, and
PySide6 6.11.2 is the newest release available. Reproduced directly: building
any non-mouse `NSEvent` and asking it for `clickCount` aborts the interpreter.

**This file is a copy of `lab_hub/ui/appkit_guard.py`, deliberately.** There is
no shared package in this workspace to put it in, and the lab has already paid
for vendoring something long-lived (`lab_hub/tools/convert`). This one is
different in the way that matters: it exists only until Qt ships a fixed cocoa
plugin, and then **both copies are deleted together**. Keep them identical —
if you change one, change the other, and check `AGENTS.md` for which other apps
have a tray menu and therefore need it too.

## The guard

Replace `-[NSEvent clickCount]` with an implementation that answers 0 for the
event types that have no click count, and calls the original for the mouse
events that do. That is what the caller expects for a non-mouse event, and it
is what AppKit's own documentation describes the value as meaning.

Swizzling a framework method is not something to do lightly, so this one is
deliberately narrow: one selector, an unchanged answer for every event the
method was ever valid for, and a clean failure that leaves AppKit untouched if
any step does not resolve. Remove it when Qt ships a fixed cocoa plugin — the
test that proves it is `tests/test_appkit_guard.py`.
